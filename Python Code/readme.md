This folder contains the implementation of Neural Network model for predicting satisfaction index for each user against another user having certain personality scores.

These personality scores are calculated by data collected from users. For that, the users are asked to fill out a questionnaire (readily available on internet), and based on the received responses, the personality scores are ascertained.
